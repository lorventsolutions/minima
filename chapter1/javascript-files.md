# Javascript Files

Js files are located in the folder js/. They are:-

* jquery.min.js
* js/bootstrap.min.js
* leftmenu.js
* metisMenu.js
* vendors/screenfull/js/screenfull.min.js

The above files are further combined into a single file called app.js and it can be found in destination directory\(js/\) which is done with the help of gulp.

app.js is placed in all pages. And also every page has its own js file which can be found in src/js/pages/.
