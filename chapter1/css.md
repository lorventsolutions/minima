# CSS Files

We have a css file called app.css which is a combination of the following files:-

* bootstrap.css
* font-awesome.min.css
* vendors/wenk/css/wenk.min.css
* metisMenu.css

app.css is placed in the destination directory \(css/app.css\) which is done with the help of gulp. It is placed in all pages and also every page has its own css file which can be found in src/css/pages/
